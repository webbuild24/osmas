The establishment of Omolaja Sodipo Memorial Anglican School was a result of the philanthropic idea of Isaac Ademoye Omolaja Sodipo of Ikereku in Abeokuta. Chief Omolaja Sodipo died in 1966 and bequeathed the net proceeds from his estate to the Anglican Mission for the founding of a school. It was however not until 1994 when the executor of his will, Justice Adenekan Ademola carried out his bequest that the ground was cleared for making his dream come true. Almost immediately, the Diocesan Bishop, Rev. Dr. Matthew Oluremi Owadayo, at the dawn of the Episcopal Service, set up a Management Committee which was later restructured into a Board of Governors for the realization of Omolaja Sodipo’s endowment.



It is indeed worth celebrating God’s love and mercy on this notable citadel of learning which started on October  9, 1995 with a short divine service by the pioneer Proprietor, RT Rev. Dr. M.O. Owadayo(rtd), the then Lord Bishop of Egba Diocese.



The Bible enjoins us not to despise the days of little beginning; Omolaja Sodipo Memorial Anglican School which started with only fifteen students (8 boys and 7 girls) now has over five hundred students. Glory be to God. When the glory of God is in focus on any project ,it thrives because our God is faithful.



I seize this opportunity to congratulate all stakeholders of this noble school for how it started, what the school is now and what it will be in future.



FROM THE BEGINNING



The labours of the pioneer Principal and Vice-Principal (Chief A. C. O, Sodeinde and Mr. J. F. Ekundayo) in nurturing the tender school twenty years ago cannot be overemphasized. The school started with the pioneer fifteen students listed below:



Koleade Oluwapemi

Ogunbiyi Taiwo

Azeez Bolanle

Okanlawon Ibukunoluwa

Olanrewaju Folasade

Obasuyi Isaiah

Sanyaolu Mayowa

Oluwemimo Oluwasogo

Todowede Christianah

Awoyomi Olamide

Adesanya Kofoworola

Sanyaolu Damilare

Ajayi-Obe Akinola

Adekunle Adetola

They started steering the ship of the School with eight other permanent pioneering staff (listed below) and a few part-time teachers.



Rev. E. K. O. Onabanjo     –              Teacher and Chaplain

Mr. Adesina Sode               –              Teacher and Housemaster

Miss Olanike O. Odejoke (now Mrs. Irozu) – Teacher and Housemistress

Mr. F.A Idowu                    –              Bursar

Mr. S.A. Jolaoso                 –              Clerk/Typist

Mr. Imoh Etuk                    –              Office Assistant

Mrs. Kemi Oginni              –              Cook

Mr. T.A Sobande                –              Gardener

The pioneer work started from the ordering of double-bunk beds, to big notes, drawing books, renovation of buildings and repair of electrical fittings among others.  More teachers were employed and the School’s Board of Governors was inaugurated with Dr. J.A. O. Sofolahan (a renowned technocrat of the 6-3-3-4 National Policy on Education Implementation Committee) as the Chairman. The then Provost of the Cathedral Church of St. Peter, Ake, Abeokuka Very Revd. J.A. Popoola (now Bishop of Osun Diocese) became the next Board of Governors Chairman after the resignation of Dr. J.A. O. Sofolahan being the Bishop’s Education Adviser. Different school activities were introduced like Carol Service and Excursion among others.  The School continued to grow from 15 students in 1995 to about 100 in 1998 so also the staff strength.



THE COMING IN OF THE ICON



A new Principal in person of Chief J.A. Paseda took up the leadership mantle of the School consequent upon the expiration of Chief A.C.O. Sodeinde’s contract appointment in May, 1999.  Chief J.A. Paseda was a former Principal and Co-ordinating Principal of Lagos State Model College.       The school witnessed tremendous growth infrastructurally, numerically and academically during Chief Paseda’s tenure, having expended all his past wealth of experience as Principal and Inspector on the young and tender School. The school curriculum expanded to accommodate subjects in the liberal Arts, Sciences, Social Sciences, Vocational, Commercial, Technical and the Languages.  As the School grew, so also the Parents’ Teachers’ Association (PTA) with the emergence of Chief O.B.A Abayomi as the second PTA Chairman after Mr. Yomi Bolasodun who was the first PTA Chiarman.



During the period in view, several landmark achievements were recorded which included the WASSCE recognition inspection by both the Ministry of Education and West African Examination Council and the subsequent approval of the School for the WASSC Examinations. Laboratories were built and equipped, the School Library was expanded and stocked with recent books on various fields. School buildings were renovated to give the school a befitting outlook. Career and motivational talks were organized for the students to build them up for the future. More teachers were employed including Revd. J.D. Omole (now Ven. and Vice Principal) who was posted as English Language teacher and Chaplain. Staff salary was reviewed forward and the students population increased to about 300 by year 2000. Indeed it was progress in all forms. Halleluyah. By 12th October, 2000 the School was formerly recognized to write the May/June 2001 WASSC Examination with Centre No. 4280224.  The School continued to wax stronger physically, numerically and academically as student make exploits in different fields of endeavour.



 



In view of the increase in students’ population, the school started its two streams  in JS 1. The then BOG chairman, Very Revd. J. A. Popoola was elected as the Bishop of Osun Diocese in June 2000, this led to the appointment of Revd. Canon (now Ven.) A. A. Masominu, the Administrative Assistant to the Bishop as the Chairman of the School’s Board of Governors The School moved to the fast lane of modernization with the opening of a computer Laboratory with computers and printer. In preparation of the students for their WASSC Examination, the Principal, Chief J.A. Paseda started teaching the students Geography (his field of specialization) on Saturdays. At the passing out of the first set of the School Ambassadors (26 of them) a valedictory service was organized for them. The service was presided over by the then Bishop and School Proprietor, Rt. Rev. Dr. M.O. Owadayo followed by a reception chaired by the then Registrar of the Diocese, Chief ‘Tayo Folade. Justice J. A. O. Sofolahan gave an inspiring speech on “Discipline”. Parents and well wishers attended the ceremony in large numbers. It was indeed a festival.



The journey of OSMAS was not without its ups and downs as thieves broke into the science laboratories on August 20, 2001 carting away equipments worth hundreds of Naira. The Police were called in but there was no arrest made. The results of the first set ambassadors was released in October 2001 and it was indeed a brilliant outing with Ese Uwadiae No 4280224/025 who had the best result with:



English Language         A1                                           Biology                        B3



Mathematics                  A1                                           Geography                  B3



Physics                            A1                                           Economics                  C4



Chemistry                       B2                                           Yoruba                        C4



Further Mathematics   B2



By February 2003, four member NECO Accreditation Team inspected the School and formally approved the School for the NECO SSC Examination with the comment: “The School is a model of what a Secondary School should be and they have well disciplined staff and students”.



In March, 2004 the School formally registered the staff to participate in the Nigerian Social Insurance Trust Fund (NSITF) scheme. A scheme which still continues till now as the Pension of teachers, thereby securing their future. The Federal Government of Nigeria has now endorsed the contributory Pension Scheme for all Government workers. In February 2003, the news of the death of an old student of the School, Olakunle Vera-Cruz, an undergraduate of Babcock University was announced. He was reported to have drowned when his School went on excursion to the Bar-Beach in Lagos. A short divine service was held in his honour in the School. Thereafter annual cash prizes was endowed in his honour by his father, Dr. Vera-Cruz for best students and also to teachers. Annual  amount allocated to the Principal was used to open an Olakunle Vera-Cruz Memorial Corner in the School library. The amount is used to update this corner with recent books every year as long as the cash is given to the School. Dr. Vera-Cruz and his family was honoured by the School in November 3, 2010 during the Speech and Prize-giving Ceremony.



The School Cooperative and Thrift Society was started in 2004 and it is still very active and helping the Staff to achieve a lot like getting land, vehicle etc. up till now. Thanks to the Principal, Chief J. A. Paseda & Mr. J. A. Olayinka for the initiative.



The School started the three (3) arms in JS 1 in September 2003 and by October 2005, the School rolled out the drums for a week long celebration to mark the tenth (10th) year celebration amidst pomp and pageantry. The line up of programme for the week were:

They are:

After a worthy meritorious service of seven years and four months, the indefatigable, hardworking and purpose driven Principal, Chief J. A. Paseda retired from the School in August, 2006. He was given a befitting send forth ceremony with his family during the School’s Christmas Carol in December, 2006. Gifts were presented by the School, Staff, Students, PTA and others.

We have just started, as we can see from our achievements listed, we are bold to say like Paul in Philippians 3:12 “Not that that I have already attained, or am already perfected, but I press on, that I may lay hold of that for which Christ Jesus has also laid hold of me”.
