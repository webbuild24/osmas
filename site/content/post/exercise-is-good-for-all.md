It’s another annual sporting fiesta in the School. How splendid! It is a special one indeed being the 15th Inter-house Sports competition marking the 20th year Anniversary of our great School.  “ For physical training (exercise) is of some value, but godliness has value for all things……..” 1 Tim. 4: 8( NIV) Spiritual and physical exercises are good for the body therefore, the inclusion of sports and games in the curriculum is not a mistake as it has an important role to play in the total well-being of the child. During this fiesta, you could exhibit some talents which you do not even know that you have and you may bury for life, a talent/skill given to you by God through your laziness, lack of focus and indiscipline.

Exercise, which precedes all sporting activities, helps the body to be active, improves health, curbs boredom and empowers boys and girls, even adults for an all-round development, making both spectators and competitors mentally and physically alert and relaxed.

Sports, being the connection between mind and body, is the best means of physical development as it provides not only exercise for the body but also recreation for the mind, hence students return to their studies feeling refreshed and energetic. 

Exercise and sports help to forge new relationships and brings people together in spite of differences in race, tribe, tongue and religion. It is capable of promoting good character through the spirit of sportsmanship. For instance, the moment a referee brings a boxing bout to a close, the boxers will hug each other; same for the game of football where players hug each other and exchange their jerseys after a match. Sport is a leveller as it creates a level playing ground for all participants. It brings excitement and joy to people.

Virtually, there is no group not involved in exercise and sports. We have Primary, Secondary, Colleges of Education, Polytechnics, Universities, Ministries, Naval, Police, disabled and even recently, orphanage- house games among others. Indeed, sports is good and necessary for all. To the competitors of today, a true spirit of sportsmanship is expected of you, noting that we cannot all win at the same time. To those who win this time, do not rest on your oars and to those who lose, do not be discouraged but see the loss as a challenge to improve on your performance next year.

I use this medium to plead with the officials to perform their duties without fear or favour, bearing in mind that an otherwise good competition might be spoilt by poor officiating. To our patrons and parents, we solicit for your continual support both now and after this occasion. We appreciate all the support you have been giving in the past as we look forward to more of these and pray the Lord to continue to replenish your purse in Jesus name.

On our own part, we will strive to achieve the goal of being “ First Among Equals” both academically and otherwise and this we hope to achieve through the grace of God and the co-operation of you, our devoted parents. Once again, my lord Bishop and Proprietor, Chairman, Chairperson, all other protocols duly extended, I sincerely welcome you all to this 15th Annual Inter-house Sports fiesta on the occasion of our 20th Founder’s Day Anniversary.

Enjoy yourselves and remain blessed in Jesus name. Amen.
