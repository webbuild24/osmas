  Ever since I was young, I always wanted to help people. I wanted to make their
  lives better, which would eventually make me better too. If I ever saw someone
  hurt or crying, I would be the first person to go and offer a helping hand. I
  don’t know if that was what my parents taught me or if that was just the type
  of person I was suppose to be but whatever it was, I always help. I find
  pleasure helping someone.

Ever since I was young, I always wanted to help people. I wanted to make their lives better, which would eventually make me better too. If I ever saw someone hurt or crying, I would be the first person to go and offer a helping hand. I don’t know if that was what my parents taught me or if that was just the type of person I was suppose to be but whatever it was, I always help. I find pleasure helping someone.

To make a difference in this world, you have to continue to help people, start making a difference in people’s lives and make the world a better place, one step at a time. I remember in Government class, we would always read about people who did amazing things in their lives. I remember people like Martin Luther King Jnr. and Abraham Lincoln, how these people persevered in life and kept going despite the challenges they encountered. So I learnt from them that it is impossible to be confident and self assured if one’s thought are filled with self doubt, so, one has to eliminate negative thinking out of one’s life the same way we take out garbage when it starts to smell or takes up too much space.

I have to realize that my success and happiness rely on thinking constructive thoughts, acting with intent and creating strong relationship with other people. My father taught me when I was in Elementary School to remove the “it can’t be done attitude”. He once asked me rhetorically, “have you known someone who proved valuable in life because of his ability to identify all the reasons why something could not be done in life?”. No, of course not. Modern organization need people who will take the high road and lead them to success through positive thinking and finding solutions. Since then I have to be positive through challenges of life since .I have since developed a solution- oriented attitude which brings result faster. So I learnt early in life that if I have to be different in life, I have to change my thinking first.

Though I am still young, I know I can make a difference. I know I can stand out tall among the crowd. I can make a difference wherever I go, that’s the way I want my life to be. Making a difference through my character, diligence and forthrightness in a dark generation by being honest, upright and hardworking in my life. Ghadi once said “You must be the change you want to see in the world”. Making a difference does not only help the person who gets helped but it can be really life changing for you too. I want to make the world a better place.

One thing that is important for us all is to be kind, caring and helpful, it doesn’t matter if it’s as small as just smiling at someone, you would still be making a big difference in the world. When I look back at all I have done in my 16 year s, I realize that making a difference is what I want to be remembered for in this school. I don’t want it for the fame or the glory. I know that I have a destiny to do much more in the future. So I challenge you to go and make a difference and fulfill destiny in life. First check your thoughts, they seem to become words, which become your actions, which become your habit, which become your character and ultimately becomes your destiny.

Dare to be different and make a positive impact in life thereby leaving behind a lasting legacy for generations to come. LONG LIVE OSMAS !
