Our Dear Children,

We congratulate each of you, SS3 Graduating Students of OSMAS in a very special way on this joyful occasion of realizing, your dream of successful completion of your academic pursuit in this great citadel of learning. We also rejoice with your respective parents and guardians for witnessing the occasion. With gratitude to God, for the grace of the accomplishment in your lives, we pray God to grant you long life with good health and you will achieve more successes in all your future endeavors.

MESSAGE THEME:

With the Year Book, a memoir in your honour being put together for this occasion with the theme, “ Make a difference by being different: dare to stand out ’’,we are pleased to contribute this goodwill message as your parting gift. It seems to us that the familiar Biblical story of Daniel, noting especially chapters 1 & 6, is most appropriate to illustrate this relevant and timely theme, at the present state of our national development. King Nebuchadnezzer ordered his Chief official to train selected Israelites that were captives in Babylon, fed from the king’s table and taught them the Babylonian language and literature so they could qualify to serve in the Palace of King Babylon. Daniel was among the selected captives. But he decided not to defile himself and requested the Chief official to test him by feeding him with only vegetables and water, which the official grudgingly agreed to do for ten (10) days. When 10 days elapsed, Daniel looked healthier and better nourished than those who ate the royal food. The trainees were eventually presented before the King and Daniel got chosen over the others because he was found to be ten times better in wisdom and knowledge! At the stage King Darius appointed Daniel to a top political post due to the divine favour, other officials were jealous and planned his downfall for his impeccable character and dedication to duty However, his enemies could not justifiably accuse him. So they deceived the king to forbid any other form of worship than to himself for a period of thirty days. Having ascertained the king’s approval in writing, they publicised a decree that meant death in the lion’s den for defaulters. The decree notwithstanding, Daniel held fast to his faith and prayed thrice daily as was his habit. His detractors caught Daniel praying to God and quickly reported him to the king. Daniel’s enemies slandered him and accused him of disobedience to the royal edict, urging King Darius to execute the death penalty by throwing Daniel into the lion’s den. Though unhappy, the King gave royal approval according to the irrevocable law of the kingdom, while a stone was used to seal the entrance of the den. It seemed that all hope was gone for Daniel that night. The following day the king hurried to the lion’s den and, to his surprise , found Daniel alive, kept by the power and providence of God, who had shut the mouths of the lions. The overjoyed King then had Daniel released from the den while throwing his accusers into the lion’s den were they were devoured.

PERSONAL IMPLICATIONS OF THIS MESSAGE:

1.It is pertinent for us note that it is the grace of God in a life that makes the difference. As you leave OSMAS, determined like Daniel ,to live a righteous and undefiled life and watch how God makes the difference in your life;

2.God has good plans for each and every one of his children, including you (Jer.29:11).he desires to lift you up in your studies, work, business and /ministry. But you need to be like Daniel; shun corruption, imbibe faithfulness and diligence;

3.People may dislike you but trust God for your protection, noting that he loves you. Be consistent worshiping only the living God and then, no weapon, no lion’s den, no charms, no wicked plot nor demonic attacks shall overcome you. If you stand firm like Daniel, God will always see you through victoriously!

4.If you are persecuted for righteousness sake, God will not only protect you but also provide a way of escape for you (see I COR. 13:10 ); 

5.You may experience hard times caused by others or even weep at night because of your seemingly peculiar situation. If you trust the Lord and look unto Jesus Christ, He will feel your mouth with laughter and judge your detractors (see Ps. 30:5; Matt. 5:11, 12).

CONCLUSION:

Our dear children we conclude this message with the refrain to an old song by Michael Dawson Gregory and others entitled, “Dare to be Daniel”, which goes thus:

Dare to be a Daniel,

Dare to stand alone!

Dare to have a purpose firm!

And Dare to make it known.

Thank you. May God bless and prosper all your future endeavours, so much that you will often put smiles of joy on the faces of your parent/guardians, teachers and mentors. Amen. Congratulations!
