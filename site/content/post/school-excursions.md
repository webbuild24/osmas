  Excursion broadens the students’ horizon, building intelligence, promoting and
  strengthening knowledge and exposure to different societies and cultures.  It
  gives the students a firsthand experience of what they have learned and read
  in the classrooms, majestically placing them on an unforgettable pedestal of
  knowledge. Omolaja Sodipo Memorial Anglican School does not deny its students
  of such opportunities, hence we embark on excursions regularly.  Here are some
  of the trips undertaken since inception
