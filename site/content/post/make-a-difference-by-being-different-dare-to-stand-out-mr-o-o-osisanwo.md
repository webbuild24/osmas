title: 'MAKE A DIFFERENCE BY BEING DIFFERENT: DARE TO STAND OUT! - Mr. O. O. Osisanwo'

description: >-
  You have all come to a point in your lifetime when you have to step out to be
  the best you can. Life is competitive. What you venture into from this point,
  determines the kind of adventure that will follow. You cannot remain static
  because life is not static. You have to move out and show the world what stuff
  you are made of. Make a difference where others are indifferent to life’s
  situation. Dare what you have not dared before in a positive way and you
  become the desirable.

You have all come to a point in your lifetime when you have to step out to be the best you can. Life is competitive. What you venture into from this point, determines the kind of adventure that will follow. You cannot remain static because life is not static. You have to move out and show the world what stuff you are made of. Make a difference where others are indifferent to life’s situation. Dare what you have not dared before in a positive way and you become the desirable. 

You have all proved to be a set of highly disciplined and morally upright students. You should keep this up. Your seniors are watching you! Some of them have dared to stand out beyond expectation. I find it needful to intimate you with some of them and not necessarily intimidate you!

Our overall best  student in the 2018 WASSCE  ( with 7 As and 2 Bs) the young, talented and versatile  Ogunfunmilayo Rekiyah, has not ceased keeping  her pace at the University of Ilorin as a medical student by ‘raking’ in all the A’s in 8 out of her 9 courses in her just concluded 1st semester exam. What an excellent performance! She decided to stand out and will not allow herself to be intimidated by anyone. Time will tell of what will become of her in the nearest future. She consistently stood out while in OSMAS.

Aiyedun Tilewa and Adekanmbi ‘Sewa, although not among the 2018 best five students, they have decided to stand out at Afe Babalola

Time will fail me to tell of Ogunlami Titilayo, the rugged pharmacist who is presently pulling her weight in the University of Ibadan with a CGPA of 3.86 out of 4 after the completion of her 200 level and Emuemhonjie Idialu, who had a CGPA of 3.84 out of 4 in his 100 level result from the department of Medicine & Surgery also in the University of Ibadan. The accountant-in-the-making, Cephas  Cephas  Ogenerukeuwe, who was  one of the best five of the 2017 set is having an easy ride at the University of Benin with a CGPA of 4.72 after his 100 level!
If all these and many more are doing very well in their tertiary institutions, you cannot do less. You MUST make a difference wherever you find yourself in your chosen career. I am highly encouraged by your 2019 MOCK UTME results. It was an impressive result and I have no doubt of your ability to defend those results in the tertiary institutions. Bello-Oro John has made history as the very first student to score as high as 329 in the UTME, 2019. This is a great achievement for the school. Thank you for making the school proud.  While I celebrate all of you, permit me to ‘jingle this bell’:

It gives me joy that your set has showed potentials for genius. While some of you have consistently stood out from JS 1, some are yet to discover the genius in you but I assure you that it’s there. I have no doubt in my mind that we have first class materials amongst you. Discover yourself and stand out! 
As I celebrate you all, I cannot but celebrate the current JAMB Registrar, Prof. Is-haq Oloyede, a man of integrity and purpose, who is working tirelessly and effortlessly in bringing sanity to the educational system of the Nation by releasing genuine results that show a true picture of the candidate’s ability and performance. Since 2017 UTME, we have had it quite splendid and rewarding with this outstanding performance:

You all are going places beyond your dreams and aspirations in life. Your team spirit had paid off for you. Please, remember that you cannot write your history and your School becomes a history! Your story is made enviable by your accomplishments, so dare to stand out. Stand out for:
 excellence and dignity;
good morals and discipline;
purity and loyalty;
stand out for the best and nothing less!
Remember that WE HAVE A STANDARD. WE SET THE STANDARD, YOU KEEP AND MAINTAIN THE STANDARD.
AT THE END OF THE DAY, YOU BECOME THE STANDARD AND REFERENCE POINT THAT STANDS OUT ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD WHILE WE SUSTAIN THE STANDARD AFTER YOU EXIT THE SCHOOL!
As you go, do not join the multitude to sin. Remember the son and daughter of whom you are. Others may do the wrong thing but not you. Make it a deliberate act to be different and God will differentiate you amidst your peers.
“ …and Daniel purposed in his heart that he WILL NOT defile himself with the King’s meat…” (Dan. 1: 8) He and the three Hebrew children stood out!
Again, “…and Daniel began to distinguish himself out of the 120 commissioners and out of the 3 superior commissioners…” ( Dan.6 : 1-3)
“Do you see a man who is diligent in his business? He will stand before kings and not before mere men.” ( Prov. 22: 29)
If you must make a difference, you must always be diligent. Diligence makes the difference!
Go and stand out. When others are standing, you will out-stand them!
