  Knowledge and know – how are the keys to success. As Basketball coach Pat

  To start with, I would like to thank God for making me finish this part of my
  life successfully and also for keeping me alive to prepare me for another race
  in life. I would like to appreciate the Lord Bishop for his effort in
  maintaining the standard of this school, our Principal, the Vice Principals,
  members of Staff and juniors for assisting me in achieving what I have
  achieved so far. I cannot forget the effort of my parents in building me.
  Thank you.

Knowledge and know – how are the keys to success. As Basketball coach Pat Riley said “if you are not getting better, you are getting worse!”

To start with, I would like to thank God for making me finish this part of my life successfully and also for keeping me alive to prepare me for another race in life. I would like to appreciate the Lord Bishop for his effort in maintaining the standard of this school, our Principal, the Vice Principals, members of Staff and juniors for assisting me in achieving what I have achieved so far. I cannot forget the effort of my parents in building me. Thank you.

I believe that everybody is born unique but through the years we work out to be like everyone else. No one gets ahead by copying the status quo by imitating competitors. We are born differently so the concept of “ROLE MODEL” has passed so I think we are in the area of being different and it can be done by standing out and there must be real passion in trying to stand out. Standing out means you being yourself doing your things your own way different from others and this requires a lot of courage because people will tell that you are doing the wrong thing, whenever you come across people like that just say in your heart “I am not going to join them, I know I have an abundance of potentials within me”.

Even the Holy Bible emphasizes the need to be different in the book of Daniel, the Bible recorded that Daniel and his friends decided to stand out by not defiling themselves with the king’s rich food and in the end they were fatter and better in appearance than other youths, I’m very sure some other youths envied them. Still in the book of Daniel, the Bible recorded in chapter 1 verse 20 that they were better in wisdom and understanding so the output of being different is increase in wisdom and understanding. However, this concept of being different is in two parts; the negative difference and the positive difference. Osama Bin Laden made a difference during his own time but a negative difference which is affecting generations up to this present day; Albert Einstein was different and his difference is what has affected our lives today. Physicist talk about Albert Einstein everytime, if he was not different, all what we enjoy today will not be there, even our Lord Jesus Christ was different by deciding to die for our sins when no other person offered. So the concept of being different is as important as that.

To my juniors, being different or even standing out does not depend on age. How old was Justin Bieber when he started shaking the world with his music? How old was Michael Jackson when he started shaking the world with his music? They did these because they were different but they didn’t do it for God. Your difference goes a long way in shaping others’ views and even their life-styles so live your life well “YOU MIGHT BE THE BIBLE SOME PEOPLE MAY READ”, however, do not be discouraged in trying to be different because not everybody will like you.

I would like to close with this Bible passage I like so much, Philipians 4:8 “Finally, brethren, whatever is true, whatever is honourable, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is gracious, if there is any EXCELLENCE, if there is anything worthy of praise, THINK ABOUT THESE THINGS”.

Au Revoir, see you at the top.
