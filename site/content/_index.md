    The establishment of Omolaja Sodipo Memorial Anglican School was a result of
    the philanthropic idea of Isaac Ademoye Omolaja Sodipo of Ikereku in
    Abeokuta. Chief Omolaja Sodipo died in 1966 and bequeathed the net proceeds
    from his estate to the Anglican Mission for the founding of a school. It was
    however not until 1994 when the executor of his will, Justice Adenekan
    Ademola carried out his bequest that the ground was cleared for making his
    dream come true.
