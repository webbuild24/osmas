                                <p>Whao! It&rsquo;s another six years already just like yesterday. The journey has been long, tasking, hazardous and exciting but thank God you are passing out gloriously. It shall be well with all of you in Jesus&rsquo; name.</p>
                                <p><em>&ldquo;The past is behind, learn from it</em></p>
                                <p><em>The future is ahead, prepare for it</em></p>
                                <p><em>The present is here, live it&rdquo;</em></p>
                                <p>The difference between the impossible and the possible lies in a man&rsquo;s determination &ndash; Tommy Lasuda. Most of us have had an occasion in which we were publicly ridiculed for being different in some ways. The feeling of embarrassment, humiliation and shame that resulted taught us to avoid being different at all cost. Our need for acceptance and approval may have even sacrificed our uniqueness to the point that we are now unable to fully express ourselves creatively.</p>
                                <p>To be outstanding, be prepared to withstand the crowd and stand out. It requires some courage to tackle the fear of standing out.</p>
                                <p>Some doctors conducted an experiment (research) in which they drew 3 lines; one short, one medium and one long. Ten people were told to vote which one was the longest line after they had instructed 9 of them to vote the medium line as the longest. In the course of voting, the only person not instructed noticed that everyone voted the medium line as the longest. He disagreed initially and insisted that the long line was the longest. However, in the long run as his mates were voting the medium sized line as the longest, he felt that something must be wrong with his answer and himself; he too changed his mind and voted along their line, i.e the medium line as the longest. (Extracted from April 2019 Daily Manna) Our true identity is expressed in our differences, not our conformity.</p>
                                <p>It takes courage to say or do the right thing or take the right decision. It takes courage to stand for God or the truth.</p>
                                <p>Romans 12:2 urges us not to be conformed to this world but to be transformed by the renewing of our minds. Don&rsquo;t follow the multitude, follow God, stand for the truth no matter the circumstance. That way, you will stand out in your generation. If you don&rsquo;t enjoy what everybody likes, stand by it. If you have another opinion, say it. If you don&rsquo;t want to join your friends for the hottest event of the year, don&rsquo;t go. What matters is that you feel good about yourself. It might mean not being part of the majority. So what?</p>
                                <p>If the only way to popularity is by compromising your true self, then turn down the offer. Accept that you can&rsquo;t be loved by everyone, and choose not to make your well-being dependent on others. Yes, standing out means being vulnerable, and it opens us up to the risk of being ridiculed, but it also gives us the possibility of letting our uniqueness shine and show others who we really are. Watch out for yourself and dare to be different as you enter the higher institution.</p>
                                <p>Too many of us have sacrificed our true identity in order to fit in with what is culturally acceptable. Compromising our uniqueness for cultural acceptance only diminishes our dreams to the lowest common denominator. If we never discover the beauty and wonder of the way God created us, we will live out someone else&rsquo;s. I wonder how much we have lost of our uniqueness by trying to conform to other people&rsquo;s expectations and standards.</p>
                                <p>I encourage you to ask God to unlock your imagination and dream without the borders that define what others have done or believe is acceptable. Sometimes, dreams are like eggs, they are hatched in stages.</p>
                                <p>We must continue to dream despite setbacks, as we continually take risks to put our dreams into action. Let&rsquo;s not forget that the only thing that separates those who become great is that they never gave up. As we take courage in the way God made us, we will find that the world has been waiting to see the &ldquo;real us&rdquo;. When we are willing to express our uniqueness, it will give others the courage to do the same, and it won&rsquo;t be long until our differences will make a difference and make the world we live in a better place &ndash; Heaven on earth. Let&rsquo;s stand up together and say &ldquo;This is me&rdquo; making no apology that we are different.</p>
                                <p>The ultimate measure of a man is not where he stands in moments of comfort, but where he stands in seasons of challenge. If God be for you, who or what can be against you? (Rom 8:31). The difference between a successful person and others is not a lack of strength or a lack of knowledge, but rather a lack of will.</p>
                                <p>A secret of success is holding on despite the odds against you. So hold on to what you know about God and what He told you about your tomorrow. After every BUMP, There is a BUMPER.</p>
                                <p>&lsquo;The world will accommodate you for not fitting in but will only reward you for standing out. Don&rsquo;t run with the crowd; fly with the stars &ndash; Matshona Dhliwayo. Until you are committed to your goals, God cannot be committed to you.</p>
                                <p>Daniel stood out alone with God. So also Shadrack, Meshack and Abednego and the Lord exalted his name through them.</p>
                                <p>Men will read of your story and glorify God. The zenith shall be your ultimate in Jesus&rsquo; name.</p>
                                <p>We say a big thank you to all our friends and well wishers for sharing in our joy. Your day of joy will not elude you in Jesus&rsquo; name.</p>
                                <p>We appreciate and congratulate our parents and guardians for believing and trusting us with these children for the past six years. Your joy on them will be permanent and you will reap the fruit of your labour on them. They have been impacted spiritually, physically, socially, morally and academically, they will neither fail nor falter and your expectations on them will not be cut short. They will always stand out for good among their peers in Jesus&rsquo; name.</p>
                                <p>Thank you all and God bless you. FAREWELL.</p>
